## 🧠 My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS Custom Properties**  
- **Flexbox**  
- **Responsive Design** with media queries  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  

---

### What I learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Using **CSS variables** for consistent design control  
- Applying **flexbox** and **responsive units** (`clamp()`, `%`, `vw`) for scalable layouts  
- Structuring clean and maintainable CSS with reusable spacing and typography tokens  

## 🚀 Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Adding **animations** or subtle transitions for smoother user experiences  
- Practicing **CSS Grid** for more complex layouts  
- Exploring **accessibility best practices** (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, etc.)

## 📚 Useful resources

- [**CSS Tricks – A Complete Guide to Flexbox**](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) – Helped solidify my understanding of layout.  
- [**MDN Web Docs**](https://developer.mozilla.org/) – Always helpful for checking syntax and best practices.
